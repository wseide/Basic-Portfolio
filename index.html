                <p>Fueled by my passion for learning and understanding is why this website exist. I consider myself a
                    lifetime student where I can learn and build on my academic foundations in Business Administration
                    and now in web development. Working the last two years as an application associate, I realize that I
                    want to build the application instead of break fixing them when they break.</p>
                <p>Please check out my website and see what I have designed. I am open to criticism as it will help me
                    get better.</p>
                <p>Please contact me with with any concerns that you may have.</p>
